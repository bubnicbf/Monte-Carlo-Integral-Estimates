#Monte Carlo Integral Estimates over the Unit Wedge in 3D

C++ library which uses the Monte Carlo method to estimate the integral of a function over the interior of the unit wedge in 3D

####The interior of the unit wedge in 3D is defined by the constraints:

        0 <= X
        0 <= Y
             X + Y <= 1
       -1 <= Z <= +1
